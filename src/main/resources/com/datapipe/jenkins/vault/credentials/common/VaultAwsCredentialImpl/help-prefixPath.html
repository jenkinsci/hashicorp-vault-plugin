<div>
  The secret engine prefix path. Use this to identify the path the secret engine (i.e. <code>kv</code>)
  is mounted to if it is not mounted at the root.
  <p>
    For example if the secret path is "<code>team1/kv/database</code>" the prefix path would be "<code>team1/kv</code>".
    If the secret path is "<code>kv/database</code>" the prefix path can be left blank.
